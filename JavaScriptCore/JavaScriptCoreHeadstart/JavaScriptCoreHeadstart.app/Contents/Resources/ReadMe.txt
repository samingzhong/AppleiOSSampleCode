JavaScriptCoreHeadstart
====================

ABOUT:

JavaScriptCore is a new system framework available in Mac OS X 10.5 that allows applications to run JavaScripts.   This sample shows one way to use JavaScriptCore for providing user configurable features in a Cocoa application.  Here, a number of JavaScript objects are defined that represent various parts of the application and the application's controller is really just a thin shell that calls JavaScripts that decide how the application will operate in response to Interface Builder action method calls and WebKit delegate callbacks.  The JavaScripts themselves control the application through the objects that represent different parts of the application.
